## Notes & Reminders

**Key Decisions Needed from Client:**
1. Exact persona names (or approve suggested ones)
2. Pricing display strategy (show prices or "contact for quote")
3. Preferred email marketing platform
4. Resource PDFs (who creates them?)
5. Professional photography (budget? photographer?)

**Potential Scope Creep to Watch:**
- "Can we add a blog?" → Phase 2
- "Let's do Bahasa Malaysia too" → Phase 2
- "Can we integrate with our CRM?" → Depends on CRM
- "Add video testimonials" → Get videos first, then add

**Remember:**
- ✅ Get client approval at each major milestone
- ✅ Test on mobile CONSTANTLY
- ✅ Document all decisions
- ✅ Keep client updated weekly
- ✅ Buffer time for revisions
- ✅ Get content early or project will delay
