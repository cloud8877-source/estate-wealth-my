---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Client:** Estate Wealth MY - Estate Planning Services for Malaysian Non-Muslims  
**Project Type:** Website Redesign + Lead Generation Quiz System  
**Primary Goal:** Generate qualified leads through a personalized "Reaction Chain" quiz funnel  
**Secondary Goals:**

- Segment audiences for personalized follow-up
- Build email list with engaged prospects

---

## 2. TECH STACK RECOMMENDATION

### ✅ **RECOMMENDED: Next.js 14 (App Router) + Tailwind CSS**

**Why Next.js over React or HTML:**

#### Advantages:
1. **SEO Critical for Estate Planning**
   - Server-side rendering = better Google rankings
   - Dynamic metadata for each page
   - Structured data for local business
   - Estate planning requires trust → high search visibility essential

2. **Quiz System Complexity**
   - Built-in API routes for quiz logic
   - Easy form handling with Server Actions
   - Can store quiz results server-side
   - Progressive enhancement (works without JS)

3. **Future-Proof & Scalable**
   - Can add blog/resources section easily
   - Client portal potential (for document uploads)
   - Integration with CRM/email marketing
   - Image optimization built-in (professional photos important)

4. **Performance**
   - Fast loading = better conversions
   - Automatic code splitting
   - Optimized Core Web Vitals (Google ranking factor)

#### Why NOT React+Vite:
- No built-in SEO optimization (critical miss for estate planning)
- Client-side rendering poor for landing pages
- More complex API integration for quiz

#### Why NOT HTML:
- Quiz logic would be extremely complex
- No easy way to handle dynamic content
- Limited scalability for future features
- Harder to maintain as business grows

### Tech Stack Details:
```
- Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- React 18+ with Server Components
- Tailwind CSS + Custom Design System
- React Hook Form (for quiz/contact forms)
- Framer Motion (subtle animations for trust)
- Nodemailer (email notifications)
- Google Sheets API (quiz results storage)
- Vercel Analytics (track conversion paths)
```

## 18. CONCLUSION

This estate planning website with a quiz funnel system is a **strategic lead generation machine** following the "Reaction Chain" philosophy. Instead of a one-size-fits-all sales funnel, you're building a diagnostic system that:

✅ **Identifies unique client contexts**  
✅ **Delivers personalized value immediately**  
✅ **Creates multiple conversion pathways**  
✅ **Builds long-term relationships**  
✅ **Generates valuable data for optimization**

**Next.js is the right choice** because:
- SEO is critical for trust-based services
- Quiz system needs robust architecture
- Future scalability (blog, resources, client portal)
- Professional performance expectations

**Realistic timeline: 10 weeks**  
**Recommended budget: RM12,000-18,000**  
**Expected ROI: 3-5x within 6 months**

This is a sophisticated project that goes beyond a typical brochure website. The quiz system is the differentiator that will generate quality leads on autopilot once properly set up.
